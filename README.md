# Todo-List-Project
A todo list application that uses jQuery to handle the many events used to create this functioning app.
In this project, you are able to add and delete items to your todo list. To add, simply write your todo in the form and then click enter. To delete, hover over the todo item and a trashcan icon will appear for you to delete. Another function is that you can cross out items on your todo list just by clicking on the todo content, not the trashcan, which crosses it out without deleting the item! One last function is that you can toggle on and off the "add todo" form with the plus sign in the topright hand corner of the app.
